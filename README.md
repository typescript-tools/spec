# TypeScript Tools Specification

This repository describes the target specification that each implementation of the
`typescript-tools` must implement.

Implementations are free to provide additional functionality, but should implement
this base specification to provide a reasonable expectation that swapping one
implementation for another will not produce changes in behavior.

Before defining the specification, it may be helpful to level set with a
[high-level overview of the project].
